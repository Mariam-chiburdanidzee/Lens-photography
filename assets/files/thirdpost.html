                <p>Picture it: Yosemite Valley, 1861. There were no roads yet, but a photographer by the name of
                    Carleton Watkins was there, alone in the vast landscape and surrounded by the sounds of the
                    waterfalls. With him was a custom camera, equipped with a wide-angle lens. His goal was to show the
                    rest of the world the beauty of this pristine wilderness.
                </p>

                <p>Three years later, President Lincoln signed a bill banning development in the area and protecting it
                    for future generations. In the intervening decades, many photographers would follow in Watkins’s
                    footsteps, documenting Yosemite through angles, seasons, and eras he might have only dreamed of.

                    Today, landscape and nature photography are as rich and diverse as ever. Gear is more accessible,
                    and awareness about the importance of conservation has risen. As the genre continues to soar in
                    popularity, we put together this essential guide for landscape photographers, including those just
                    setting out on their own, as Watkins did all those years ago. Whether you’re shooting flowing water
                    in the mountains, misty twilight in the forest, or sunlit sand dunes in the desert—landscape
                    photography is vast and ever-expanding—you can use these tips to your advantage..</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Pack light!</h2>
                <p>While camera equipment has gotten considerably lighter than it once was, you still want to be
                    mindful of how much you’re carrying. Bring too much, and you’ll be in pain and weighed down, which
                    will prevent you from exploring and making the most of your trip. A purpose-built camera backpack
                    can make the process much easier; do your research and try a few on to see what works for you. A
                    camera strap or clip will help you keep your camera accessible when you need it..</p>

                <p>With weight in mind, pack only the essential gear. A wide-angle lens is the go-to choice for many
                    landscape photographers, with some opting for a 16-35mm for that larger field of view (Iurie
                    Belegurschi, for instance, is known for his jaw-dropping wide-angle landscapes, many of which were
                    made with a 16-35mm). Instead of packing multiple primes, go for a zoom.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Incorporate reflections</h2>
                <img src="../images/blog-images/third-post-img/stock-photo-1057354465.jpg" alt="landscape">
                <p>Reflections open up the possibility of mixing things up and seeing a familiar scene differently. They
                    can also reinforce your composition: in Annie Fu’s photograph of a frost flower-covered pond
                    (below), the reflection of the very tip of a sunlit Mount Rundle—like a downward-facing arrow—just
                    barely touches the bottom horizontal third’s line, making for a subtle but enchanting scene.</p>
                <img src="../images/blog-images/third-post-img/stock-photo-1014382586.jpg" alt="landscape">
                <p>Dramatic skies, especially around sunrise or sunset with intriguing cloud formations, also lend
                    themselves well to reflections. Just beware of windy days; calm mornings tend to work best for
                    smooth reflections.</p>
                <h2 class="post-title">Embrace all weather conditions</h2>
                <p>As long as you’re being safe and keeping your gear safe (and bringing microfiber cloths for your
                    lens), there’s no rule that says you have to wait for perfect blue skies. By getting out there in
                    rain, fog, mist, and snow, you’ll learn to overcome challenges and adapt to the landscape, while
                    seeing it in a new light every time you visit. Waterfalls, in particular, can be spectacular in the
                    rain, as the photographer Jens Ober discovered while exploring Iceland on “dull” and cloudy days.

                <p>Another benefit of storms, particularly in springtime, is the possibility of rainbows. Consider
                    placing your horizon line slightly lower than you normally might to capture the majesty of the sky,
                    as Patryk Bieganski did on a stormy summer’s day in Poland.</p>

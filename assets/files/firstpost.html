                <p>Black and white street photography has a long history, dating back to the 1930s, when Henri
                    Cartier-Bresson roamed the hidden corners of Paris and Walker Evans and Helen Levitt rode the New
                    York
                    City subway.

                <p>In the following decades, even as color photography began to dominate—first in advertising, then in
                    fine art—pioneering street photographers continued to shoot in black and white for its timeless
                    quality and effortless simplicity. Nearly a century later, many still do. In the last five years,
                    Lomography, CatLABS, Fujifilm, and Kosmo Foto all announced new (or revived) black and white films.

                    Without the distraction of color, a moment can be distilled to its essence or core. Whether you’re
                    just starting out with street photography or considering a fresh approach, working in monochrome can
                    teach you to see your surroundings in a new way.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Save in RAW format</h2>
                <p>This one’s for digital photographers: shooting in RAW format will give you the freedom and
                    flexibility to edit/finesse your shadows and highlights when you convert to black and white in
                    post-production.

                    If you use an electronic viewfinder (mirrorless cameras have these), you can set it to show
                    black-and-white preview images as you’re shooting—but you can still save the RAW color files for
                    later. This approach can be helpful when training yourself to “see” in black and white.</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Seek moments of contrast</h2>
                <p>When you remove color, your work becomes all about light, so look for scenes with plenty of contrast
                    between light and dark (and with gray tones in between). While most photographers avoid the hard
                    sunlight of midday, these conditions can be an asset for artists shooting in black and white. In
                    Japan, Y Uzen used shadows to creative effect when photographing a cat around noon.

                    Try visiting a location during different hours to see how the light—and subsequently, the
                    contrast–changes throughout the day. At the golden hour, the shadows will get softer but also
                    longer. At nighttime, streetlights and illuminated storefronts can create a pool of light, while
                    allowing the rest of the frame to fall into darkness.</p>
                <h2 class="post-title">Experiment with reflectionst</h2>
                <p>To add interest to a photograph without color, consider using reflections in your surroundings. This
                    photograph by Benny van den Bulke feels like a modern twist on Henri Cartier-Bresson’s iconic Behind
                    the Gare Saint-Lazare; instead of jumping over a puddle, however, the subject in this picture steps
                    over a toilet leak.</p>
                <img src="../images/blog-images/first-post-img/sea-and-ship.jpg" alt="sea-and-ship">
                <p>You can also use windows to create double-exposure-like layers within a single frame, à la Vivian
                    Maier, who often photographed her own reflection. While on a boat, for example, the Istanbul-based
                    photographer Emir Bozkurt used reflections to capture the interior and exterior scene at the same
                    time.</p>
                <img src="../images/blog-images/first-post-img/birds.jpg" alt="birds">
                <p>Geoffrey Black, on the other hand, used the reflection from a shiny car to incorporate the lines and
                    patterns of a nearby building. In doing so, he created balance and repetition between the foreground
                    and background.</p>

                <p>In recognition of Women’s Month, the Women in Photography Photo Walk event was held on March 25th in
                    Orlando, FL. The event welcomed more than 50 guests to network and foster an encouraging atmosphere
                    for female photographers. Although the event attracted a diverse crowd of supporters of all genders
                    and ages, it focused on empowering women to pursue their photographic dreams without fear. Attendees
                    had the chance to hone their skills under the tutelage of fellow photographers as well as access
                    giveaways and educational materials sponsored by 500px, Sony Alpha Female, and Narrative App. By
                    encouraging social activities such as a photo walk around the city, this inclusive environment
                    served to remind aspiring top-tier female photographers that they should dare to conquer the world
                    with their creative brilliance.

                <p>At the Women in Photography Photo Walk, Angela Perez and Mary Bel shared their expertise and
                    discussed their professional journeys. The event began with the two photographers offering up
                    valuable advice to those in attendance. They spoke about their art and past achievements as women in
                    the industry, impressing attendees with their commitment to forging a supportive network. </p>

                <p>After gathering, participants set off on a photo tour of Orlando, capturing street scenes while
                    learning from seasoned professionals. During the tour, our attendees had a chance to learn about our
                    sponsors. Notable mentions include 500px, an online resource for photography; Sony Alpha Female,
                    which provides funding for female photographers; and Narrative App, designed to help photographers
                    tell stories through photos.</p>

                <p>Rather than just being informative, this event was also uplifting – bringing together like-minded
                    people in an environment filled with educators, sponsors, and most importantly: communities of
                    support. Women have come far in the field of photography – events like this only increase our drive
                    to recognize and celebrate these accomplishments. Women are joining forces by sharing their
                    knowledge – this is what introduces true growth in any profession. </p>

                <p>Overall, the event was a powerful reminder of the importance of creating spaces and opportunities for
                    women in the photography industry. By coming together, sharing knowledge and experiences, and
                    offering support and encouragement, women are breaking down barriers and paving the way for future
                    generations of female photographers.</p>
